# Guideline: Designing Mobile-First Table Data Displays for Smaller Screens

When presenting large datasets, such as user profiles (e.g., Username, Email, Roles, Actions), on smaller screens, particularly mobile devices, a mobile-first design approach is essential. Traditional desktop-oriented table layouts often fail on mobile due to limited screen real estate, touch-based interactions, and the need for scannability. This guideline outlines best practices to create accessible, user-friendly, and responsive table data displays, prioritizing mobile usability while ensuring adaptability for larger screens.

## 1. Shift to Card-Based Layouts for Mobile

### Why Use Cards?
- **Readability**: Cards encapsulate each data entry (e.g., a user profile) into a distinct, scannable unit, avoiding the clutter of traditional tables on small screens.
- **Touch-Friendly**: Cards provide a larger tap target, making interactions like tapping to edit or delete more accessible.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Cards allow for clear separation of information, with prominent elements (e.g., Username) at the top and secondary details (e.g., Email, Roles) below.

### Implementation Tips
- **Transform Rows into Cards**: Convert each table row into an individual card on mobile. For example, a user profile row with Username, Email, Roles, and Actions becomes a card with these fields stacked vertically.
- **Consistent Card Structure**: Ensure each card follows a predictable layout (e.g., Username as the header, Email and Roles below, Actions at the bottom).
- **Spacing and Separation**: Use adequate padding within cards (e.g., 16px) and spacing between cards (e.g., 12px) to avoid visual clutter. Subtle background color variations or dividers can enhance separation without overwhelming the user.

### Insights from References

## 2. Prioritize and Structure Information for Mobile

### Focus on Essential Data
- **Minimalism**: Display only the most critical fields on mobile to avoid overwhelming the user. For a user profile, prioritize fields like Username and a primary Role, with secondary details like Email or full role lists available via progressive disclosure.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide less critical or detailed information behind interactions like expandable sections, modals, or bottom sheets. For example, tapping a user card can reveal additional details or actions.

### Establish Visual Hierarchy
- **Prominent Key Fields**: Make the primary identifier (e.g., Username) stand out with larger font sizes (e.g., heading size), bold weight, or increased contrast.
- **Secondary Information**: Use smaller font sizes or lighter colors for secondary fields like Email or Roles to create a clear hierarchy.
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related information together (e.g., user details at the top, roles in a separate section, actions at the bottom) to improve scannability.

### Enhance Readability
- **Typography**: Use clear, legible sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans) with a minimum size of 16px for body text to ensure readability on mobile.
- **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background (WCAG recommends a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text).
- **Whitespace**: Employ adequate padding and margins (e.g., 8-16px) to prevent a cluttered appearance.
- **Alignment**: Left-align text for left-to-right (LTR) languages to align with natural reading patterns; right-align numbers if present (e.g., permission counts).

### Insights from References

## 3. Design for Touch and Mobile Interactions

### Touch-Friendly Call-to-Actions (CTAs)
- **Button Size**: Ensure action buttons (e.g., Edit, Delete) are large enough for touch (minimum 44x44px as per Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines or 48x48px per Google’s Material Design).
- **Spacing**: Provide sufficient spacing between buttons (e.g., 8px) to prevent accidental taps.
- **Icons with Labels**: Use universally understood icons (e.g., pencil for Edit, trash for Delete) paired with labels if space permits. If using icons alone, ensure they are intuitive (e.g., avoid ambiguous symbols).
- **Consistent Placement**: Place actions consistently across cards, such as at the bottom or in a top-right “more options” menu (e.g., three-dot icon).

### Progressive Disclosure for Actions
- **Modals/Bottom Sheets**: Use modals or bottom sheets for detailed actions (e.g., editing roles) to keep the initial card view uncluttered.
- **Expandable Sections**: Allow users to tap a card to expand additional details (e.g., full role list) or reveal more actions.
- **Swipe Gestures**: Consider swipe actions for common tasks (e.g., swipe left to delete) if appropriate, but ensure they are discoverable and optional to avoid accidental triggers.

### Insights from References

## 4. Ensure Scannability and Navigation

### Clear Separation Between Entries
- **Dividers or Backgrounds**: Use dividers or subtle background color variations (e.g., zebra striping with light gray) to separate cards. Avoid excessive visual noise by keeping color differences minimal.
- **Card Containers**: Each card should have a distinct border or shadow to visually separate it from others, enhancing scannability.

### Search and Filtering
- **Mobile-Friendly Inputs**: Ensure search bars and filters are touch-friendly, with large input fields and clear icons (e.g., magnifying glass for search, X for clearing).
- **Collapsible Filters**: On mobile, collapse filters into a dropdown or modal to save space, revealing them only when needed.
- **Sticky Search Bar**: Consider making the search bar sticky at the top of the screen for easy access while scrolling through a long list.

### Pagination and Load More
- **Load More Button**: For large datasets, use a “Load More” button at the bottom of the list instead of traditional pagination, as it’s more intuitive on mobile.
- **Simplified Pagination**: If pagination is necessary, use simple controls (e.g., “Previous” and “Next” buttons) with clear labels and large tap targets.
- **Avoid Overloading**: Limit the initial load to 10-20 items, fetching more as the user scrolls or taps “Load More” to prevent performance issues.

### Insights from References
- **UX Matters**: Advocates for “Load More” over traditional pagination on mobile, as it reduces cognitive load and fits the scrolling behavior of mobile users.
- **Justinmind**: Recommends sticky search bars and collapsible filters to maintain usability on small screens, ensuring users can quickly find relevant data.

## 5. Responsive and Adaptive Behavior

### Distinct Layouts for Mobile vs. Desktop
- **Mobile-First Design**: Start with a card-based layout for mobile, then adapt to a traditional table for desktop screens where more horizontal space is available.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Use responsive design techniques to switch layouts based on screen size. For example, in Reflex, leverage `rx.mobile_and_tablet` for card views and `rx.desktop_only` for table views.
- **Avoid Shrinking Tables**: Simply scaling down a table for mobile often leads to unreadable text and cramped interactions. Instead, redesign the layout for mobile (e.g., cards) and desktop (e.g., table) separately.

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Define Breakpoints**: Use mobile-first breakpoints to adjust layouts:
  - **Initial (xs)**: Single-column card layout for mobile (e.g., <576px).
  - **Small (sm)**: Adjust spacing or card width (e.g., 576px-767px).
  - **Medium (md)**: Transition to a table layout for tablets/desktops (e.g., ≥768px).
- **Fluid Adjustments**: Ensure elements like buttons, text, and cards scale fluidly with `width="100%"` or percentage-based sizing to adapt to varying screen widths.

### Touch-Friendly Interactions
- **Tap-to-Expand**: Allow users to tap a card to reveal more details or actions, aligning with mobile interaction patterns.
- **Avoid Horizontal Scrolling**: If horizontal scrolling is unavoidable (e.g., for very wide data), fix the first column (e.g., Username) to provide context while scrolling. However, prefer card layouts to eliminate this need.
- **Gesture Support**: Support natural mobile gestures like swipe-to-refresh or pinch-to-zoom if relevant, but ensure they are intuitive and optional.
