# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the inventory system, replacing legacy flag-based authorization (e.g., `is_admin`, `is_supplier`) with a flexible role and permission model. The RBAC system supports roles (`admin`, `employee`, `supplier`) and permissions (`manage_users`, `manage_suppliers`, `view_inventory`, etc.), enabling fine-grained access control.

## Models

The RBAC system is built on SQLModel models defined in `inventory_system/models/user.py`:

- **UserInfo**:
  - Stores user metadata (e.g., `email`, `user_id`).
  - Links to roles via the `UserRole` association table.
  - Methods:
    - `get_roles() -> list[str]`: Retrieves the user's roles (e.g., `["admin", "employee"]`).
    - `set_roles(role_names: list[str], session: Session)`: Assigns roles atomically, using `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to prevent race conditions.
- **Role**:
  - Defines roles (e.g., `name="admin"`, `description="Administrator role"`).
  - Links to permissions via the `RolePermission` association table.
  - Methods:
    - `get_permissions() -> list[str]`: Retrieves the role's permissions (e.g., `["manage_users", "view_inventory"]`).
    - `set_permissions(permission_names: list[str], session: Session)`: Assigns permissions atomically with `SELECT FOR UPDATE`.
- **Permission**:
  - Defines permissions (e.g., `name="manage_users"`, `description="Manage user accounts"`).
  - Linked to roles via `RolePermission`.
- **UserRole**:
  - Association table mapping `UserInfo` to `Role` (composite key: `user_id`, `role_id`).
- **RolePermission**:
  - Association table mapping `Role` to `Permission` (composite key: `role_id`, `permission_id`).

## Role and Permission Management

- **Roles**: `admin`, `employee`, `supplier` (lowercase, per convention).
- **Permissions**: Include `manage_users`, `manage_suppliers`, `view_inventory`, `create_inventory`, `update_inventory`, `delete_inventory`, and more (seeded via `seed_permissions.py`).
- **Assignment**:
  - Roles are assigned to users via `UserInfo.set_roles` (e.g., `user.set_roles(["admin"], session)`).
  - Permissions are assigned to roles via `Role.set_permissions` (e.g., `role.set_permissions(["manage_users"], session)`).
- **State Handlers**:
  - `user_mgmt_state.py`: `change_user_role` uses `set_roles` to update user roles.
  - `supplier_approval_state.py`: `approve_supplier` assigns the `supplier` role to new users.
  - `admin_state.py`: Displays user roles and supplier statuses, using `get_roles`.

## Race Condition Protections

To prevent race conditions in concurrent role or permission assignments:

- **Locking**:
  - `UserInfo.set_roles` and `Role.set_permissions` use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` to lock the respective records (`UserInfo` or `Role`) during updates.
  - `user_mgmt_state.py`: `change_user_role` and `delete_user` use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on `UserInfo`.
  - `supplier_approval_state.py`: `approve_supplier`, `revoke_supplier`, and `delete_supplier` use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on `Supplier` and `UserInfo` (when applicable).
- **Transactions**:
  - All database operations use `with rx.session() as session` for atomicity, with automatic rollbacks on errors.
- **Testing**:
  - `test_concurrent_role_assignment` in `test_permission.py` verifies atomicity using an in-memory SQLite database.
  - Production testing is planned with PostgreSQL, using tools like Locust to simulate concurrent `change_user_role` or `approve_supplier` calls.
- **Future Considerations**:
  - If deadlocks occur in production, optimistic locking (e.g., a version column) may be added in **Step 6**.

## Audit Logging

Audit logging, implemented in `inventory_system/logging/audit.py`, tracks all role and permission changes:

- **Events**:
  - `create_userrole`, `create_rolepermission`: Log role/permission assignments.
  - `update_userinfo`, `delete_userinfo`: Log user updates/deletions.
  - `attempt_change_role`, `success_change_role`, `fail_change_role`: Log role changes in `user_mgmt_state.py`.
  - `attempt_approve_supplier`, `success_approve_supplier_new_user`, etc.: Log supplier actions in `supplier_approval_state.py`.
- **Handling Association Tables**:
  - `UserRole` and `RolePermission` lack a single `id` field, so composite keys (e.g., `f"{user_id}-{role_id}"`) are used for `entity_id`.
- **Tests**:
  - `test_audit_logging_roles` and `test_audit_logging_permissions` verify logging for `UserRole` and `RolePermission` changes.

## State and Authorization Updates

- **user_mgmt_state.py**:
  - Replaced `is_admin` with `"manage_users" in get_permissions()` for authorization.
  - Uses `set_roles` for role updates, ensuring atomicity.
- **supplier_approval_state.py**:
  - Replaced `is_admin` with `"manage_suppliers" in get_permissions()`.
  - Assigns `supplier` role atomically in `approve_supplier`.
- **admin_state.py**:
  - Replaced `is_admin` with `"manage_users" or "manage_suppliers" in get_permissions()`.
  - Displays single roles (temporary, pending multi-role support in **Step 6**).
- **auth_state.py** (assumed):
  - Removed `is_admin` flag, relying on `get_permissions` for authorization.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests** (`test_permission.py`):
  - `test_create_permission`, `test_unique_permission_name`, `test_update_timestamp`: Verify `Permission` model.
  - `test_permission_deletion_cascade`: Ensures cascading deletes for `RolePermission`.
  - `test_role_permissions_relationship`, `test_role_users_relationship`: Verify many-to-many relationships.
  - `test_userinfo_roles`, `test_role_permissions`: Test `get_roles`, `set_roles`, `get_permissions`, `set_permissions`.
  - `test_concurrent_role_assignment`: Verifies atomic role assignments.
  - `test_audit_logging_roles`, `test_audit_logging_permissions`: Verify audit logging.
- **Production Testing**:
  - Planned for PostgreSQL environment to simulate concurrent role assignments and supplier approvals.

## Step 4: Implement Permission Checks
**Status**: Completed  
**Details**:  
- Added `get_permissions()` and `has_permission()` to `UserInfo`.  
- Added `permissions` to `AuthState` with eager loading.  
- Enhanced `seed_permissions.py` with action-specific permissions (e.g., `view_supplier`, `delete_user`) and legacy permissions (`manage_users`, `manage_suppliers`).  
- Created `seed_roles.py` for `admin`, `employee`, `supplier`, `inventory_manager`, `supplier_manager`, `auditor` roles.  
- Updated `test_permission.py` with tests for new permissions and roles.

### Conclusion
Step 5 is fully complete, with all modules transitioned to permission-based authorization. The successful execution of `test_user_registration_step5` (with minor modifications) confirms the robustness of the registration process, resolving prior issues (e.g., audit log errors). Navigation bar and sidebar updates ensure secure, permission-gated navigation, and the final code audit verifies no legacy flag-based checks remain. The test suite validates RBAC functionality across all components, ensuring security and scalability. The system is now ready to proceed to Step 6, which will focus on implementing dynamic role management to further enhance the RBAC system.

## Step 6: Implement Role Management - Objectives, Steps, Challenges, Action Plan, and Implementation Summary

### Objectives
Step 6 aims to extend the RBAC system by implementing dynamic role management, enabling administrators to create, update, and delete roles, as well as assign permissions dynamically. This enhances flexibility for multi-role users and permission management, building on Step 5’s permission-based authorization. The primary focus is on updating `user_mgmt_state.py` and `user_management.py` to provide a robust UI and state handlers for role management, ensuring concurrency safety, audit logging, and responsive design.

### Steps
The following steps outline the implementation of dynamic role management:

1. **Update Models for Role Management**  
   - Enhance the `Role` model in `user.py` to include metadata (e.g., `is_active` flag for soft deletion).  
   - Add methods like `create_role` and `delete_role` with type hints, audit logging, and atomic operations using `SELECT FOR UPDATE`.  

2. **Extend State Handlers**  
   - Update `user_mgmt_state.py` to include handlers for role management (e.g., `create_role`, `update_role_permissions`, `delete_role`).  
   - Use `@rx.background` for database operations and `@rx.event` for UI-driven events, ensuring non-blocking UI with `yield` for sequential updates.  

3. **Enhance UI for Role Management**  
   - Update `user_management.py` to include a role management interface (e.g., modal or dedicated page with multi-select dropdowns for permissions).  
   - Use `rx.foreach` for role lists, `rx.cond` for permission-based rendering, and Reflex breakpoints (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`) for responsive design.  

4. **Add Audit Logging**  
   - Extend `audit.py` to log role creation, updates, and deletions (e.g., `create_role`, `update_role`, `delete_role` events).  
   - Handle composite keys for `UserRole` and `RolePermission` (e.g., `f"{role_id}-{permission_id}"`) in audit logs.  

5. **Update Tests**  
   - Add tests in `test_permission.py` for role management (e.g., `test_create_role`, `test_delete_role`, `test_concurrent_role_update`).  
   - Validate audit logging, concurrency safety, and UI rendering under different permissions.  

6. **Production Testing**  
   - Deploy to staging and use Locust to simulate concurrent role creation and permission assignments.  
   - Monitor audit logs for errors, deadlocks, or unexpected overwrites in a PostgreSQL environment.  

### Challenges
The following challenges may arise during Step 6 implementation, with mitigation strategies:

1. **Concurrency**  
   - **Challenge**: Concurrent role creation or permission updates may cause race conditions or deadlocks, especially in high-traffic scenarios.  
   - **Mitigation**: Use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` in `create_role` and `update_role_permissions` to lock records. Monitor for deadlocks in production testing and consider optimistic locking (e.g., version column) if needed.  

2. **UI Complexity**  
   - **Challenge**: Designing an intuitive UI for multi-role and permission management (e.g., multi-select dropdowns) while ensuring responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices.  
   - **Mitigation**: Use Reflex components like `rx.select` with `rx.foreach` for permissions, adhering to breakpoints (per [Reflex Breakpoints](https://reflex.dev/docs/styling/responsive/)). Test UI on multiple screen sizes.  

3. **Audit Logging**  
   - **Challenge**: Logging detailed role changes (e.g., permission additions/removals) without overwhelming audit logs, especially for composite keys.  
   - **Mitigation**: Structure logs with clear `entity_id` (e.g., `role_id`) and `details` fields, summarizing changes efficiently. Test log readability in `test_audit_logging_roles`.  

4. **Backward Compatibility**  
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring predefined roles (`admin`, `employee`, `supplier`) remain functional during dynamic role management.  
   - **Mitigation**: Protect seeded roles in `seed_roles.py` with checks in `delete_role` (e.g., prevent deletion of `admin`). Validate compatibility in tests.  

5. **Performance**  
   - **Challenge**: Bulk permission assignments for roles may impact database performance, especially with large permission sets.  
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize `set_permissions` with bulk queries (e.g., `in_` clauses) and index `RolePermission` table. Profile performance in staging.  

### Action Plan
The following to-do list prioritizes tasks to ensure a successful Step 6 implementation:

- [ ] Update `user.py` to add `create_role` and `delete_role` methods with Python 3.10+ type hints, audit logging, and `SELECT FOR UPDATE`.  
- [ ] Implement `create_role`, `update_role_permissions`, and `delete_role` handlers in `user_mgmt_state.py` using `@rx.background` for database operations and `@rx.event` for UI triggers, with `try-except` and `rx.toast` for error feedback.  
- [ ] Design role management UI in `user_management.py` with multi-select dropdowns (`rx.select`), `rx.cond` for permission checks, and responsive breakpoints (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`).  
- [ ] Extend `audit.py` to log `create_role`, `update_role`, and `delete_role` events, ensuring composite key support for `UserRole` and `RolePermission`.  
- [ ] Add unit tests in `test_permission.py` for role creation, deletion, concurrent updates, and audit logging, using `pytest` fixtures.  
- [ ] Optimize `set_permissions` in `user.py` for bulk permission assignments, adding indexes to `RolePermission` if needed.  
- [ ] Deploy to staging and test concurrency with Locust, monitoring audit logs for deadlocks or errors in PostgreSQL.  
- [ ] Document role management patterns in `DATABASE_OPERATIONS.md`, including concurrency and performance guidelines. 
-[ ] Optimization Option: If get_permissions() is slow with many roles, add eager loading:
    from sqlalchemy.orm import selectinload
    user_info = session.merge(self.is_authenticated_and_ready).options(selectinload(UserInfo.roles).selectinload(Role.permissions))

### Implementation Summary
Step 6 will introduce dynamic role management by enhancing the `Role` model, state handlers, and UI to support role creation, updating, and deletion. Administrators will manage roles via a responsive interface in `user_management.py`, with multi-select dropdowns for permissions. State handlers in `user_mgmt_state.py` will use `@rx.background` for database operations, ensuring non-blocking UI and concurrency safety via `SELECT FOR UPDATE`. Audit logging will track all changes, and tests will validate functionality and edge cases. The implementation will optimize performance with bulk queries and maintain backward compatibility with predefined roles. Production testing with Locust will ensure scalability, preparing the system for Step 7 (user management enhancements). This approach aligns with Reflex best practices, including `@rx.event`, `setvar`, `yield` for async updates, and responsive design with dark/light theme support.

## Conclusion
Step 5’s completion marks a significant milestone, with the inventory system fully transitioned to permission-based authorization. The success of `test_user_registration_step5` and updates to navigation, code audit, and testing ensure a secure and scalable RBAC system. Step 6 will build on this foundation by enabling dynamic role management, addressing concurrency, UI, and performance challenges to deliver a flexible and user-friendly RBAC experience. The action plan provides a clear roadmap, with prioritized tasks to guide development and testing, ensuring readiness for subsequent steps.



- **Step 7: Extend User Management**:
  - Update UI to display multiple roles and permissions.
  - Add bulk role/permission assignment features.
- **Production Testing**:
  - Deploy to staging and use Locust to test concurrent role assignments and supplier actions.
  - Monitor audit logs for errors or unexpected overwrites.

## Notes

- All role names are lowercase (`admin`, `employee`, `supplier`) per convention.
- Reflex best practices are followed:
  - `@rx.event` for event handlers.
  - `setvar` for state updates.
  - No awaiting event handlers; `yield` for async updates.
  - Error handling with `try-except` and `rx.toast` for user feedback.
- The system is designed to support PostgreSQL in production, with `SELECT FOR UPDATE` ensuring concurrency safety.
