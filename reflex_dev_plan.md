# Reflex Web Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Supply Chain Management System  
**Framework:** Reflex  
**Started:** 2025-03-15  
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-20

---

## Current Status
- [x] Basic project structure
- [x] Permissions management UI
- [x]User authentication system
- [ ] Supplier management module
- [ ] Inventory tracking system

---

## Immediate Tasks (Next 1-2 Days)

### ðŸ”´ High Priority
- [x] **Fix permission card length issue** - Cards length is not consisted
- [x] **Permission could be  deleted without checking role** - enable soft deletion--check before it's assinged to role.
- [x] **Fix logger username issue** - Need to update logger implementation with curret auth.
- [x]**remove unnecessary method from permisson state** - There are some unnecessary methods.
- [x]**add logger during update, create and change** - no direct logger in permission state

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
- [ ] **Add bulk operations for permissions** - Select multiple permissions for batch actions

## Discovered Issues & Anomalies

### 2024-01-20
**Issue:** Permission cards not maintaining consistent height in grid  
**Impact:** UI looks messy with varying card sizes  
**Solution:** Set fixed height (200px) and handle overflow  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed  

**Issue:** Search filter not debounced, causing performance issues  
**Impact:** API calls on every keystroke  
**Solution:** Add 300ms debounce to search input  
**Status:** âœ… Fixed

## Feature Requests & Enhancements

### UX Improvements
- [ ] **Toast notification center** - History of recent notifications

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] **Real-time updates** - WebSocket integration for live updates

## Architecture Decisions

### 2024-01-18: State Management
**Decision:** Use Reflex's built-in state management instead of external libraries  
**Rationale:** Keep dependencies minimal, leverage framework features  
**Trade-offs:** Less flexibility but better integration  

### 2024-01-16: Styling Approach
**Decision:** Use Radix UI components with custom CSS for complex layouts  
**Rationale:** Consistent design system, accessibility built-in  
**Trade-offs:** Learning curve for Radix patterns  

---

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] **Refactor PermissionsState class** - Getting too large (500+ lines)
- [ ] **Extract custom hooks** - Repeated logic in multiple components
- [ ] **Add comprehensive error handling** - Many operations lack proper error states
- [ ] **Implement proper logging** - Add structured logging for debugging

### Testing
- [ ] **Unit tests for state management** - Critical business logic needs coverage
- [ ] **E2E tests for user flows** - Automation for common user journeys
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** - Establish baseline metrics

---

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Page load times (target: <2s)
- Time to interactive (target: <3s)
- Bundle size (current: 245KB, target: <200KB)
- API response times (target: <500ms)

### Current Issues
- Permission list rendering slow with 500+ items
- Modal animations causing frame drops on mobile
- Search functionality not optimized for large datasets

---
